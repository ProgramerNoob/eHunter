# Specification Quality Checklist: Dockable Block Layout

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning\
**Created**: 2026-02-20\
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Validation pass 1 completed with all checklist items passing.
- Scope is intentionally bounded to thumbnail panel and main content panel for initial delivery, with reusable rules defined for future blocks.
- Implementation-phase runtime checks to pass before final sign-off:
  - `npm run dev` launches successfully.
  - `ego-browser` confirms dock handle visible and reader renders without overlap.
  - Per-mode layout restoration verified for scroll and book modes.
